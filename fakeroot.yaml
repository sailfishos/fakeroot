Description: |
    fakeroot runs a command in an environment wherein it appears to have
    root privileges for file manipulation. fakeroot works by replacing the
    file manipulation library functions (chmod(2), stat(2) etc.) by ones
    that simulate the effect the real library functions would have had,
    had the user really been root.
